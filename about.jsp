                <p>At TRUE BARISTAS, we're more than just a coffee shopâ€”we're a community.
                     Our journey began with a simple passion: to craft the perfect cup of coffee and
                      create a space where people can come together to share moments, ideas, and laughter. 
                     Whether you're starting your day with a fresh brew, taking a break from your
                      busy schedule, or winding down with a relaxing cup of tea, we're here to make every sip a memorable experience.</p>
